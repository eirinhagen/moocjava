This is the "Object-Oriented Programming with Java" course from Helsinki University. It was my first time working on such a large project, so my commits aren't entirely accurate. I also had to take a break around part 10 due to exams. However, I definitely want to continue since I found the course incredibly valuable.

Originally, the course is designed to be completed using a different IDE, where you earn points for each task through an installed plugin. However, the plugin didnâ€™t work properly on my machine, so I decided to approach the exercises more flexibly. I verified the "correct" answers using the official resources while also exploring alternative solutions from other sources to find even more efficient approaches.

I did the course using IntelliJ as my main IDE.
